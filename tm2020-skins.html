                    I was so delighted to design a skin for the best mapping team at the moment on TrackMania !<br>
                    I tried a smooth design, with golden lines and textures made for their new graphic identity.<br>
                    I really like this skin, hope you like it too.

                    He gave me a lot of textures and pictures that he wanted on his samurai-themed skin and here we are.<br>
                    That was a hard challenge but the result is so nice !
