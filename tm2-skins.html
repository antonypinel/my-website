                    Probably the best skin I've ever made since I started skinning 5 years ago, everything is hand-drawed there !<br>
                    This was a really hard to challenge to draw a phoenix correctly and to make some really smooth with gradients.<br>
                    Really delighted about this one, hope you'll love it as I do.

                    This skin is a rework of their older skin that I made in 2018 when the team was named "Fury".<br>
                    A really agressive design as I used to do before, hope you will like it !

                <p class="details">
                    This is skin was for one of my best friend GGeek, who is also a very talented caster !<br>
                    Full replica of the AlphaTauri livery, which was a little bit hard to do because of sponsor placement.<br>
                    Available in two versions, the black and white version is downloadable on my discord.

                    A really nice design for a really nice team !<br>
                    I enjoyed so much to make a nordic/ice-themed skin, I played with texture and chrome and I love so much the result.<br>
                    Hope you will enjoy this skin as I do.

                    This skin has a very powerful meaning to me, this is the first skin I made once I made my comeback in skinning !<br>
                    I tried to make the cleanest design as possible for one of the sickest tech teams during this area.<br>
                    One of my best skins so far, hope you will enjoy as I do.

                    That was a hard challenge to make a skin for one of the best RPG teams !<br>
                    Really smooth design available in different versions for each player.<br>
                    This skin was the beginning of a new era for me.

                    My best skin in 2019, more than 40 hours of work to design angel wings !<br>
                    I learned so much on this skin, I made a lot of versions for each player including this rainbow version.<br>
                    Hope you'll enjoy it as I do.

                <p class="details">
                    For an upcoming competition in 2019, I had to make 50 liveries in one month which was a really hard challenge !<br>
                    We have 13 designs with 4 colored versions for each skin, with also fictionnal sponsors.<br>
                    A very interesting challenge which teached me a lot on skinning.
